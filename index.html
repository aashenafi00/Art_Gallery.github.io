      <h3>(By ICT club)</h3>
      <p>An art club is a group of individuals who share a common passion for art and creativity. The club provides a platform for members to express themselves through various forms of art, <br>
        such as painting, drawing, sculpture, or photography. Members can also learn new techniques, attend art exhibits, and participate in organized art competitions. Art clubs offer a welcoming<br> 
        and supportive environment for artists of all levels, where they can share and receive constructive feedback on their work. These clubs promote the sharing of ideas, building relationships, and<br>
         learning new skills, making them a great place for individuals to explore their creativity and connect with like-minded people.</p>
